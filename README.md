Solution to a statistics problem with simulation 

There is a game that user can roll a dice and depands on the result can move step forward or behind.If dice is 1 or 2 should take one step back, otherwise if dice is 3 or 4 or 5 should take one step forward and if it is 6 user should roll the dice again and take as much step as the second dice.
